This folder contains scripts for running Modeller to generate resting state models of Nav1.7 and Nav1.4, with all four voltage-sensing domains (VSDs) in the deactivated state. This includes the:
- template pdb structures (7xve, 6nt4, 7k48, 7w9k)
- alignment files
- python scripts to run Modeller AutoModel

Note, the C-terminal domain is not included in this homology model.
