This folder contains scripts for running Modeller to generate a resting state model of Nav1.7 and Nav1.4, with all four voltage-sensing domains (VSDs) are in the deactivated state. This includes:
- template pdb structures
- alignment files
- python scripts to run Modeller AutoModel

Note, the C-terminal domain is not included in this homology model.
